## Setup Instructions
1. First, download the source code, either by executing a `git clone https://github.com/x2dtu/snake.git` in a terminal or downloading the project as a zip through the Github page and extracting that zip.
2. This project uses python3 and a python library called pygame. In order to play, make sure you have python3 installed. In a terminal in the project working directory, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary pygame library. 
3. Finally, run `python3 snake.py` in the project directory in order to start playing the game. Good luck!

## Objective and Controls
In snake, you are supposed to eat the randomly spawned apples by moving into them with your snake's mouth. Every apple eaten will increase the size of your snake. Watch out though, because running into the edge of the screen or into part of your snake body will end the game. <br>
You can change the direction your snake slithers in using the arrow keys. To quit out of the game, press the ESC key. Hav fun!
